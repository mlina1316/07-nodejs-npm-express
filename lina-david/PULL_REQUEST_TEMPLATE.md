#Lab 07: NodeJS & NPM 

Created a server file using NodeJs and ExpressJS framework to set up a server file to handle http requests and deliver responses.

Today, Lina and David paired together. It took about 2 hours.

Reflect and summarize on your process for each TODO item :

First, forked repo then installed nodemon, and ExpressJS.

Next, we worked in text editor to add code to server.js
